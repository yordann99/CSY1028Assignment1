  Hi, my name is Yordan Nedelchev and this is my website! I am currently 18 years old and am born on the 4th February. I am of Bulgarian nationality but have lived
    in England for most of my life as I moved here when I was just 5 years old. Before I came to university I was at sixth form where I studied 4 subjects. Those subjects being Maths, Philosophy, English Language and of course IT.
    IT was my strongest and favourite subject which is why I chose to do something IT related here at university.
    <br>In terms of other facts about me, I am a huge football fan and have been all my life. I support Manchester United and I have been to see several of their matches live. I also used to play for a football team until I was 16 years old. I can also still
    speak fluent Bulgarian although I would say English is predominantly my first language as I speak it much more often. I am also a big gamer. In my spare time I like to relax and play some games on my PS4 with friends.
<br>Other than that, there is not really any interesting things things about because I am not the most interesting person in the world.
<br>Below is going to be a quick video just briefly showing some parts of some of the websites that I used in order to help me create this website:
