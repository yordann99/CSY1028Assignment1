<h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS</h1>
<p1>Below is a list of terms and their definitions which are all used in web design and development:</p1>
    <h2>CSS Terms:</h2>
    <h2> 1. PROPERTIES</h2>
    <p2>Properties are defined within selectors by defining a property and a value. They are separated with a colon and delineated with a semi-colon.</p2>
    <h2>2. PADDING</h2>
    <p2>The padding is the spacing between the content and the border (edge of the element.). We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.</p2>
    <h2>3. MARGIN</h2>
    <p2>The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.</p2>
    <h2>4. FONT FAMILY</h2>
    <p2>The font-family property sets the font of an HTML element's text.</p2>
    <h2>5. SELECTORS</h2>
    <p2>Selectors are used in CSS to select the parts of the HTML that are being styled. You can use several different methods for selecting an element.</p2>
    <h2>6. CLASS NAME SELECTORS</h2>
    <p2>Class selectors select all elements with a matching class.</p2>
    <h2>7. ELEMENT SELECTORS</h2>
    <p2>These can be selected by choosing HTML elements first by simply using the name of the element.</p2>
    <h2>8. ID SELECTORS</h2>
    <p2>ID selectors are used to select only a single item on a page. ID selectors will only select the first element with a matching ID.</p2>
    <h2> 9. ATTRIBUTE COLLECTORS</h2>
    <p2>HTML elements are also able to be selected by their attributes.</p2>
    <h2> 10. UNIVERSAL SELECTOR</h2>
    <p2>The universal selector may be used to select all the elements in a particular range.</p2>
    <h2>11. PSEUDO CLASS SELECTORS</h2>
    <p2>Pseudo Selectors can be used to narrow down a selection with certain rules.</p2>
    <h2>HTML Terms:</h2>
    <h2>1. CLASS</h2>
    <p2>HTML elements can have one or more classes, separated by spaces. You can style elements using CSS by selecting them with their classes.</p2>
    <h2> 2. ID</h2>
    <p2>A HTML element can have an ID attribute to identify it. ID elements should always be unique to that single element, and each element should never have more than one ID.</p2>
    <h2>3. HREF</h2>
    <p2>Links tell the browser where to go using an href attribute, which stores a URL.</p2>
    <h2>4. BASIC FORMATTING</h2>
    <p2>You can easily format text to be bold, italic, or underlined using simple formatting tags.</p2>
    <h2>5. BODY</h2>
    <p2>The body is the container for all of a page's content. Comes after the head tag, within the overall html tag.</p2>
    <h2>6. CHILDREN</h2>
    <p2>An element that is an immediate descendent of another element or nested within another element is called a child. These become useful when using CSS child selectors and psuedo-elements.</p2>
    <h2>7. COMMENTS</h2>
    <p2>HTML comments are sometimes used in code to explain parts of the markup. They are similar to comments in other languages. Users do not see comments in their browser.</p2>
    <h2>8. DIV</h2>
    <p2>A block level container (or 'division' of the web page) for content with no semantic meaning.</p2>
    <h2>9. HEAD</h2>
    <p2>Tag that surrounds important content that is invisible to the user, but is important to the browser.</p2>
    <h2>10. HEADINGS</h2>
    <p2>Heading elements like h1, h2, h3 etc. allow you to use six levels of document headings, ranging from largest to smallest, breaking up the document into logical sections.</p2>
    <h2>11. HORIZONTAL RULES</h2>
    <p2>This tag creates a black line one pixel thick that runs the all the way across its container. It can be styled to look differently with CSS.</p2>
    <h2>12. HTML</h2>
    <p2>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the language used to create all websites.</p2>
    <h2>13. HTML TAG</h2>
    <p2>All HTML files live within an over-arching html tag. This is the basic tag that defines an html document.</p2>
    <h2>14. HYPERLINKS</h2>
    <p2>Hyperlinks (or just links) take the user to another webpage when they click on it. The most common attribute used with links is href, which tells the browser where the link goes.</p2>
    <h2>15. IMAGES</h2>
    <p2>The img tag embeds an image into your HTML. Always found with the 'src' attribute, which tells the browser where to find the image.</p2>
    <h2>16. LINE BREAKS</h2>
    <p2>This tag is used in a block of text to force a line break. This is to be used for things which are a single paragraph, but where this formatting is necessary such as poems or addresses. To separate paragraphs, separate each paragraph into a separate element instead.</p2>
    <h2>17. LINKS</h2>
    <p2>Link elements are used to connect your document to a related resource (very different from hyperlinks, which take you to another webpage when you click on them). Links appear only in the head section of a document so they do not alter the content, but only the presentation. Links are most commonly used to connect to a stylesheet, script, favicon, or alternate format of the page such as an RSS feed or PDF.</p2>
    <h2>18. LISTS</h2>
    <p2>HTML supports two kinds of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists. Within lists each individual list item has its own tag.</p2>
    <h2>19. UNORDERED LIST</h2>
    <p2>Unordered lists are just lists whose items are denoted with bullet points.</p2>
    <h2>20. ORDERED LIST</h2>
    <p2>Ordered lists' items are denoted with numbers.</p2>
    <h2>21. PARAGRAPHS</h2>
    <p2>One of the most common tags in HTML(p and /p) - it denotes a paragraph of text.</p2>
    <h2>22. SEMANTIC FORMATTING</h2>
    <p2>The difference from formatting tags is that these tags have semantic value. em is used for something that you wish to emphasize and strong is used for something that is important. With both of these elements, you can convey the level of emphasis or importance with nesting.</p2>
    <h2>23. TABLES</h2>
    <p2>An element for displaying information in rows and columns. Supports headers and footers for labeling columns.</p2>
    <h2>24. TAGS AND ELEMENTS</h2>
    <p2>Tags are basic labels that define and separate parts of your markup into elements. They are comprised of a keyword surrounded by angle brackets. Content goes between two tags and the closing one is prefixed with a slash.</p2>
    <h2>25. TITLE</h2>
    <p2>This tag tells the browser what to display as the page title at the top and tells search engines what the title of your site is.</p2>
    <footer class="footer"></footer> 
</body>
</html>
