    <br><h2>Reflection on Web Development</h2>
    <p1>This term I have learned an unbelievable amount about web development as when I first came in to university, I knew very little about anything to do with coding a website.
      Almost every skill that I have been shown this term during web development sessions or when creating this website, has been new to me and therefore has been very useful in my progress in developing this website. 
      This is the first website that I have developed using HTML5 and CSS code so therefore I have found it difficult but overall it has been a good challenge. 
      <br>Having this first term at university to learn all these skills will be useful to me in the future if I decide to take any kind of job in web development. 
      This is why this first term has been so important as I have gained so much more knowledge about web development that I did not know before, ranging from the most basic things such as adding a title to more advanced features such as implementing videos and images as well as positioning them to be more organised on a page.
Personally, I believe that this first term of learning about web development has been extremely important as if I have to use HTML5 and CSS code in either other modules or jobs or anything else web development related, I will at least have some knowledge rather than being a complete novice.
