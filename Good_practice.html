    <br><h2>Website 1</h2>
    <br><p1>Website 1 was an inspiration towards my website for organising the top half of my home page mostly. This website structure included an image on the left hand side and the text going to its right. The additional part that I added to this is that my text also goes
      below the image but that is just one small change. Of course this website does have text under the image of its home screen as well but I have organised mine differently. 
      This current page is also inspired by this website as I have used the bottom half of the main page you can see above as an inspiration. This was used to help me decide where to position my text 
      and images. Like in the top left picture above, you can see that most of the text is below the images and it makes it look more organised so I have included the same type of design in my own work with my own twist to it.
      <br><h2>Website 2</h2>
      <br><p1>Website 2 was also used to inspire my home page mostly. Throughout the website there are several blocks of text but they are followed by either a link to a video or a video on the same screen.
        I liked this type of organisation a lot as it separates the main media from the block of text supporting the video on that same page. The structure of this website was just simple and easy to follow 
        so I chose to base some of my structure on the pages of it. Navigating around the website is one of the most important parts and making this simpler, makes everything better for the user.
